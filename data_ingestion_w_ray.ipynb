To highlight a few of the reasons you\\nmight want to use LCEL:\\nFirst-class streaming support When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-ﬁrst-token (time elapsed\\nuntil the ﬁrst chunk of output comes out).

You can view the v0.1 docs here.\\nConceptual guide\\nConceptual guide\\nThis section contains introductions to key parts of LangChain.\\nArchitecture\\nLangChain as a framework consists of a number of packages.\\nlangchain-core\\nThis package contains base abstractions of different components and ways to compose them together. The interfaces for core\\ncomponents like LLMs, vector stores, retrievers and more are deﬁned here. No third party integrations are deﬁned here. The\\ndependencies are kept purposefully very lightweight.\\nPartner packages\\nWhile the long tail of integrations are in langchain-community, we split popular integrations into their own packages (e.g.\\nlangchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc). This was done in order to improve support for these important integrations.\\nlangchain\\nThe main langchain package contains chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application\\'s cognitive\\narchitecture. These are NOT third party integrations. All chains, agents, and retrieval strategies here are NOT speciﬁc to any one\\nintegration, but rather generic across all integrations.\\nlangchain-community\\nThis package contains third party integrations that are maintained by the LangChain community. Key partner packages are\\nseparated out (see below). This contains all integrations for various components (LLMs, vector stores, retrievers). All\\ndependencies in this package are optional to keep the package as lightweight as possible.\\nlanggraph\\nlanggraph is an extension of langchain aimed at building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling\\nsteps as edges and nodes in a graph.\\nLangGraph exposes high level interfaces for creating common types of agents, as well as a low-level API for composing custom\\nﬂows.\\nlangserve\\nA package to deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs. Makes it easy to get a production ready API up and running.\\nLangSmith\\nA developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.\\nLangChain Expression Language \\x00LCEL\\x00\\nLangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to chain LangChain components. LCEL was designed from day 1 to\\nsupport putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest “prompt + LLM” chain to the most complex\\nchains (we’ve seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you\\nmight want to use LCEL:\\nFirst-class streaming support When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-ﬁrst-token (time elapsed\\nuntil the ﬁrst chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming\\noutput parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw\\ntokens.\\nAsync support Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while\\nprototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a LangServe server). This enables using the same code for prototypes\\nand in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server.\\nOptimized parallel execution Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents\\nfrom multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency.\\nRetries and fallbacks Conﬁgure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains\\nmore reliable at scale. We’re currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added\\nreliability without any latency cost.\\nAccess intermediate results For more complex chains it’s often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even\\nbefore the ﬁnal output is produced. This can be used to let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your\\nchain. You can stream intermediate results, and it’s available on every LangServe server.\\nInput and output schemas Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from\\nthe structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe.\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what\\nexactly is happening at every step. With LCEL, all steps are automatically logged to LangSmith for maximum observability and\\ndebuggability.\\nSeamless LangServe deployment Any chain created with LCEL can be easily deployed using LangServe.\\nRunnable interface\\nTo make it as easy as possible to create custom chains, we\\'ve implemented a \"Runnable\" protocol. Many LangChain components\\nimplement the Runnable protocol, including chat models, LLMs, output parsers, retrievers, prompt templates, and more. There\\nare also several useful primitives for working with runnables, which you can read about below.\\nThis is a standard interface, which makes it easy to deﬁne custom chains as well as invoke them in a standard way. The standard\\ninterface includes:\\nstream: stream back chunks of the response\\ninvoke: call the chain on an input\\nbatch: call the chain on a list of inputs\\nThese also have corresponding async methods that should be used with asyncioawait syntax for concurrency:\\nastream: stream back chunks of the response async\\nainvoke: call the chain on an input async\\nabatch: call the chain on a list of inputs async\\nastream_log: stream back intermediate steps as they happen, in addition to the ﬁnal response\\nastream_events: beta stream events as they happen in the chain (introduced in langchain-core 0.1.14)\\nThe input type and output type varies by component:\\nComponent Input Type Output Type\\nPromptDictionary PromptValue\\nChatModelSingle string, list of chat messages or a PromptValueChatMessage\\nLLM Single string, list of chat messages or a PromptValueString\\nOutputParserThe output of an LLM or ChatModel Depends on the parser\\nRetrieverSingle string List of Documents\\nTool Single string or dictionary, depending on the toolDepends on the tool\\nAll runnables expose input and output schemas to inspect the inputs and outputs:\\ninput_schema: an input Pydantic model auto-generated from the structure of the Runnable\\noutput_schema: an output Pydantic model auto-generated from the structure of the Runnable\\nComponents\\nLangChain provides standard, extendable interfaces and external integrations for various components useful for building with\\nLLMs. Some components LangChain implements, some components we rely on third-party integrations for, and others are a mix.\\nChat models\\nLanguage models that use a sequence of messages as inputs and return chat messages as outputs (as opposed to using plain\\ntext). These are traditionally newer models (older models are generally LLMs, see below). Chat models support the assignment of\\ndistinct roles to conversation messages, helping to distinguish messages from the AI, users, and instructions such as system\\nmessages.\\nAlthough the underlying models are messages in, message out, the LangChain wrappers also allow these models to take a string\\nas input. This means you can easily use chat models in place of LLMs.\\nWhen a string is passed in as input, it is converted to a HumanMessage and then passed to the underlying model.\\nLangChain does not host any Chat Models, rather we rely on third party integrations.\\nWe have some standardized parameters when constructing ChatModels:\\nmodel: the name of the model\\nChatModels also accept other parameters that are speciﬁc to that integration.\\nINFO\\nTool Calling Some chat models have been ﬁne-tuned for tool calling and provide a dedicated API for tool calling. Generally,\\nsuch models are better at tool calling than non-ﬁne-tuned models, and are recommended for use cases that require tool\\ncalling. Please see the tool calling section for more information.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use chat models, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nMultimodality\\nSome chat models are multimodal, accepting images, audio and even video as inputs. These are still less common, meaning\\nmodel providers haven\\'t standardized on the \"best\" way to deﬁne the API. Multimodal outputs are even less common. As such,\\nwe\\'ve kept our multimodal abstractions fairly light weight and plan to further solidify the multimodal APIs and interaction\\npatterns as the ﬁeld matures.\\nIn LangChain, most chat models that support multimodal inputs also accept those values in OpenAI\\'s content blocks format. So\\nfar this is restricted to image inputs. For models like Gemini which support video and other bytes input, the APIs also support the\\nnative, model-speciﬁc representations.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use multimodal models, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nFor a full list of LangChain model providers with multimodal models, check out this table.\\nLLMs\\nLanguage models that takes a string as input and returns a string. These are traditionally older models (newer models generally\\nare Chat Models, see below).\\nAlthough the underlying models are string in, string out, the LangChain wrappers also allow these models to take messages as\\ninput. This gives them the same interface as Chat Models. When messages are passed in as input, they will be formatted into a\\nstring under the hood before being passed to the underlying model.\\nLangChain does not host any LLMs, rather we rely on third party integrations.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use LLMs, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nMessages\\nSome language models take a list of messages as input and return a message. There are a few different types of messages. All\\nmessages have a role, content, and response_metadata property.\\nThe role describes WHO is saying the message. LangChain has different message classes for different roles.\\nThe content property describes the content of the message. This can be a few different things:\\nA string (most models deal this type of content)\\nA List of dictionaries (this is used for multimodal input, where the dictionary contains information about that input type and\\nthat input location)\\nHumanMessage\\nThis represents a message from the user.\\nAIMessage\\nThis represents a message from the model. In addition to the content property, these messages also have:\\nresponse_metadata\\nThe response_metadata property contains additional metadata about the response. The data here is often speciﬁc to each model\\nprovider. This is where information like log-probs and token usage may be stored.\\ntool_calls\\nThese represent a decision from an language model to call a tool. They are included as part of an AIMessage output. They can be\\naccessed from there with the .tool_calls property.\\nThis property returns a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has the following keys:\\nname: The name of the tool that should be called.\\nargs: The arguments to that tool.\\nid: The id of that tool call.\\nSystemMessage\\nThis represents a system message, which tells the model how to behave. Not every model provider supports this.\\nFunctionMessage\\nThis represents the result of a function call. In addition to role and content, this message has a name parameter which conveys\\nthe name of the function that was called to produce this result.\\nToolMessage\\nThis represents the result of a tool call. This is distinct from a FunctionMessage in order to match OpenAI\\'s function and tool\\nmessage types. In addition to role and content, this message has a tool_call_id parameter which conveys the id of the call to\\nthe tool that was called to produce this result.\\nPrompt templates\\nPrompt templates help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. This can be used to guide a\\nmodel\\'s response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.\\nPrompt Templates take as input a dictionary, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to ﬁll in.\\nPrompt Templates output a PromptValue. This PromptValue can be passed to an LLM or a ChatModel, and can also be cast to a\\nstring or a list of messages. The reason this PromptValue exists is to make it easy to switch between strings and messages.\\nThere are a few different types of prompt templates:\\nString PromptTemplates\\nThese prompt templates are used to format a single string, and generally are used for simpler inputs. For example, a common way\\nto construct and use a PromptTemplate is as follows:\\nAPI Reference:PromptTemplate\\nChatPromptTemplates\\nThese prompt templates are used to format a list of messages. These \"templates\" consist of a list of templates themselves. For\\nexample, a common way to construct and use a ChatPromptTemplate is as follows:\\nAPI Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\\nIn the above example, this ChatPromptTemplate will construct two messages when called. The ﬁrst is a system message, that has\\nno variables to format. The second is a HumanMessage, and will be formatted by the topic variable the user passes in.\\nMessagesPlaceholder\\nThis prompt template is responsible for adding a list of messages in a particular place. In the above ChatPromptTemplate, we saw\\nhow we could format two messages, each one a string. But what if we wanted the user to pass in a list of messages that we would\\nslot into a particular spot? This is how you use MessagesPlaceholder.\\nAPI Reference:ChatPromptTemplate | MessagesPlaceholder | HumanMessage\\nThis will produce a list of two messages, the ﬁrst one being a system message, and the second one being the HumanMessage we\\npassed in. If we had passed in 5 messages, then it would have produced 6 messages in total (the system message plus the 5\\npassed in). This is useful for letting a list of messages be slotted into a particular spot.\\nAn alternative way to accomplish the same thing without using the MessagesPlaceholder class explicitly is:\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use prompt templates, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nExample selectors\\nOne common prompting technique for achieving better performance is to include examples as part of the prompt. This gives the\\nlanguage model concrete examples of how it should behave. Sometimes these examples are hardcoded into the prompt, but for\\nmore advanced situations it may be nice to dynamically select them. Example Selectors are classes responsible for selecting and\\nthen formatting examples into prompts.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use example selectors, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nOutput parsers\\nNOTE\\nThe information here refers to parsers that take a text output from a model try to parse it into a more structured\\nrepresentation. More and more models are supporting function (or tool) calling, which handles this automatically. It is\\nrecommended to use function/tool calling rather than output parsing. See documentation for that here.\\nResponsible for taking the output of a model and transforming it to a more suitable format for downstream tasks. Useful when\\nyou are using LLMs to generate structured data, or to normalize output from chat models and LLMs.\\nLangChain has lots of different types of output parsers. This is a list of output parsers LangChain supports. The table below has\\nvarious pieces of information:\\nName: The name of the output parser\\nSupports Streaming: Whether the output parser supports streaming.\\nHas Format Instructions: Whether the output parser has format instructions. This is generally available except when (a) the\\ndesired schema is not speciﬁed in the prompt but rather in other parameters (like OpenAI function calling), or (b) when the\\nOutputParser wraps another OutputParser.\\nCalls LLM: Whether this output parser itself calls an LLM. This is usually only done by output parsers that attempt to correct\\nmisformatted output.\\nInput Type: Expected input type. Most output parsers work on both strings and messages, but some (like OpenAI Functions) need\\na message with speciﬁc kwargs.\\nOutput Type: The output type of the object returned by the parser.\\nDescription: Our commentary on this output parser and when to use it.\\nNameSupports\\nStreamingHas Format\\nInstructionsCalls\\nLLMInput\\nTypeOutput Type Description\\nJSON ✅✅str|\\nMessageJSON objectReturns a JSON object as\\nspeciﬁed. You can specify a\\nPydantic model and it will\\nreturn JSON for that model.\\nProbably the most reliable\\noutput parser for getting\\nstructured data that does\\nNOT use function calling.\\nXML ✅✅str|\\nMessagedictReturns a dictionary of tags.\\nUse when XML output is\\nneeded. Use with models\\nthat are good at writing\\nXML (like Anthropic\\'s).\\nCSV ✅✅str|\\nMessageList[str]Returns a list of comma\\nseparated values.\\nOutputFixing ✅str|\\nMessageWraps another output\\nparser. If that output parser\\nerrors, then this will pass\\nthe error message and the\\nbad output to an LLM and\\nask it to ﬁx the output.\\nRetryWithError ✅str|\\nMessageWraps another output\\nparser. If that output parser\\nerrors, then this will pass\\nthe original inputs, the bad\\noutput, and the error\\nmessage to an LLM and ask\\nit to ﬁx it. Compared to\\nOutputFixingParser, this\\none also sends the original\\ninstructions.\\nPydantic ✅str|\\nMessagepydantic.BaseModelTakes a user deﬁned\\nPydantic model and returns\\ndata in that format.\\nYAML ✅str|\\nMessagepydantic.BaseModelTakes a user deﬁned\\nPydantic model and returns\\ndata in that format. Uses\\nYAML to encode it.\\nPandasDataFrame ✅str|\\nMessagedictUseful for doing operations\\nwith pandas DataFrames.\\nEnum ✅str|\\nMessageEnumParses response into one of\\nthe provided enum values.\\nDatetime ✅str|\\nMessagedatetime.datetimeParses response into a\\ndatetime string.\\nStructured ✅str|\\nMessageDict[str, str]An output parser that\\nreturns structured\\ninformation. It is less\\npowerful than other output\\nparsers since it only allows\\nfor ﬁelds to be strings. This\\ncan be useful when you are\\nworking with smaller LLMs.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use output parsers, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nChat history\\nMost LLM applications have a conversational interface. An essential component of a conversation is being able to refer to\\ninformation introduced earlier in the conversation. At bare minimum, a conversational system should be able to access some\\nwindow of past messages directly.\\nThe concept of ChatHistory refers to a class in LangChain which can be used to wrap an arbitrary chain. This ChatHistory will\\nkeep track of inputs and outputs of the underlying chain, and append them as messages to a message database. Future\\ninteractions will then load those messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input.\\nDocuments\\nA Document object in LangChain contains information about some data. It has two attributes:\\npage_content: str: The content of this document. Currently is only a string.\\nmetadata: dict: Arbitrary metadata associated with this document. Can track the document id, ﬁle name, etc.\\nDocument loaders\\nThese classes load Document objects. LangChain has hundreds of integrations with various data sources to load data from: Slack,\\nNotion, Google Drive, etc.\\nEach DocumentLoader has its own speciﬁc parameters, but they can all be invoked in the same way with the .load method. An\\nexample use case is as follows:\\nAPI Reference:CSVLoader\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use document loaders, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nText spli\\ue009ers\\nOnce you\\'ve loaded documents, you\\'ll often want to transform them to better suit your application. The simplest example is you\\nmay want to split a long document into smaller chunks that can ﬁt into your model\\'s context window. LangChain has a number of\\nbuilt-in document transformers that make it easy to split, combine, ﬁlter, and otherwise manipulate documents.\\nWhen you want to deal with long pieces of text, it is necessary to split up that text into chunks. As simple as this sounds, there is a\\nlot of potential complexity here. Ideally, you want to keep the semantically related pieces of text together. What \"semantically\\nrelated\" means could depend on the type of text. This notebook showcases several ways to do that.\\nAt a high level, text splitters work as following:\\n\\x00\\x00 Split the text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks (often sentences).\\n\\x00\\x00 Start combining these small chunks into a larger chunk until you reach a certain size (as measured by some function).\\n\\x00\\x00 Once you reach that size, make that chunk its own piece of text and then start creating a new chunk of text with some overlap\\n(to keep context between chunks).\\nThat means there are two different axes along which you can customize your text splitter:\\n\\x00\\x00 How the text is split\\n\\x00\\x00 How the chunk size is measured\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use text splitters, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nEmbedding models\\nEmbedding models create a vector representation of a piece of text. You can think of a vector as an array of numbers that\\ncaptures the semantic meaning of the text. By representing the text in this way, you can perform mathematical operations that\\nallow you to do things like search for other pieces of text that are most similar in meaning. These natural language search\\ncapabilities underpin many types of context retrieval, where we provide an LLM with the relevant data it needs to effectively\\nrespond to a query.\\nThe Embeddings class is a class designed for interfacing with text embedding models. There are many different embedding\\nmodel providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc) and local models, and this class is designed to provide a standard interface\\nfor all of them.\\nThe base Embeddings class in LangChain provides two methods: one for embedding documents and one for embedding a query.\\nThe former takes as input multiple texts, while the latter takes a single text. The reason for having these as two separate methods\\nis that some embedding providers have different embedding methods for documents (to be searched over) vs queries (the search\\nquery itself).\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use embedding models, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nVector stores\\nOne of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding\\nvectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are \\'most similar\\' to the\\nembedded query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.\\nMost vector stores can also store metadata about embedded vectors and support ﬁltering on that metadata before similarity\\nsearch, allowing you more control over returned documents.\\nVector stores can be converted to the retriever interface by doing:\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use vector stores, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nRetrievers\\nA retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store. A retriever\\ndoes not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. Retrievers can be created from vector stores, but\\nare also broad enough to include Wikipedia search and Amazon Kendra.\\nRetrievers accept a string query as input and return a list of Document\\'s as output.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use retrievers, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nTools\\nTools are interfaces that an agent, a chain, or a chat model / LLM can use to interact with the world.\\nA tool consists of the following components:\\n\\x00\\x00 The name of the tool\\n\\x00\\x00 A description of what the tool does\\n\\x00\\x00 JSON schema of what the inputs to the tool are\\n\\x00\\x00 The function to call\\n\\x00\\x00 Whether the result of a tool should be returned directly to the user (only relevant for agents)\\nThe name, description and JSON schema are provided as context to the LLM, allowing the LLM to determine how to use the tool\\nappropriately.\\nGiven a list of available tools and a prompt, an LLM can request that one or more tools be invoked with appropriate arguments.\\nGenerally, when designing tools to be used by a chat model or LLM, it is important to keep in mind the following:\\nChat models that have been ﬁne-tuned for tool calling will be better at tool calling than non-ﬁne-tuned models.\\nNon ﬁne-tuned models may not be able to use tools at all, especially if the tools are complex or require multiple tool calls.\\nModels will perform better if the tools have well-chosen names, descriptions, and JSON schemas.\\nSimpler tools are generally easier for models to use than more complex tools.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use tools, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nToolkits\\nToolkits are collections of tools that are designed to be used together for speciﬁc tasks. They have convenient loading methods.\\nAll Toolkits expose a get_tools method which returns a list of tools. You can therefore do:\\nAgents\\nBy themselves, language models can\\'t take actions - they just output text. A big use case for LangChain is creating agents. Agents\\nare systems that use an LLM as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and what the inputs to those actions\\nshould be. The results of those actions can then be fed back into the agent and it determine whether more actions are needed, or\\nwhether it is okay to ﬁnish.\\nLangGraph is an extension of LangChain speciﬁcally aimed at creating highly controllable and customizable agents. Please check\\nout that documentation for a more in depth overview of agent concepts.\\nThere is a legacy agent concept in LangChain that we are moving towards deprecating: AgentExecutor. AgentExecutor was\\nessentially a runtime for agents. It was a great place to get started, however, it was not ﬂexible enough as you started to have\\nmore customized agents. In order to solve that we built LangGraph to be this ﬂexible, highly-controllable runtime.\\nIf you are still using AgentExecutor, do not fear: we still have a guide on how to use AgentExecutor. It is recommended, however,\\nthat you start to transition to LangGraph. In order to assist in this we have put together a transition guide on how to do so.\\nCallbacks\\nLangChain provides a callbacks system that allows you to hook into the various stages of your LLM application. This is useful for\\nlogging, monitoring, streaming, and other tasks.\\nYou can subscribe to these events by using the callbacks argument available throughout the API. This argument is list of handler\\nobjects, which are expected to implement one or more of the methods described below in more detail.\\nCallback Events\\nEvent Event Trigger Associated Method\\nChat model startWhen a chat model starts on_chat_model_start\\nLLM start When a llm starts on_llm_start\\nLLM new tokenWhen an llm OR chat model emits a new tokenon_llm_new_token\\nLLM ends When an llm OR chat model ends on_llm_end\\nLLM errorsWhen an llm OR chat model errors on_llm_error\\nChain startWhen a chain starts running on_chain_start\\nChain end When a chain ends on_chain_end\\nChain errorWhen a chain errors on_chain_error\\nTool start When a tool starts running on_tool_start\\nTool end When a tool ends on_tool_end\\nTool error When a tool errors on_tool_error\\nAgent actionWhen an agent takes an action on_agent_action\\nAgent ﬁnishWhen an agent ends on_agent_finish\\nRetriever startWhen a retriever starts on_retriever_start\\nRetriever endWhen a retriever ends on_retriever_end\\nRetriever errorWhen a retriever errors on_retriever_error\\nText When arbitrary text is run on_text\\nRetry When a retry event is run on_retry\\nCallback handlers\\nCallback handlers can either be sync or async:\\nSync callback handlers implement the BaseCallbackHandler interface.\\nAsync callback handlers implement the AsyncCallbackHandler interface.\\nDuring run-time LangChain conﬁgures an appropriate callback manager (e.g., CallbackManager or AsyncCallbackManager which\\nwill be responsible for calling the appropriate method on each \"registered\" callback handler when the event is triggered.\\nPassing callbacks\\nThe callbacks property is available on most objects throughout the API (Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:\\nThe callbacks are available on most objects throughout the API (Models, Tools, Agents, etc.) in two different places:\\nRequest time callbacks: Passed at the time of the request in addition to the input data. Available on all standard Runnable\\nobjects. These callbacks are INHERITED by all children of the object they are deﬁned on. For example,\\nchain.invoke({\"number\": 25}, {\"callbacks\": [handler]}).\\nConstructor callbacks: chain = TheNameOfSomeChain(callbacks=[handler]). These callbacks are passed as arguments to\\nthe constructor of the object. The callbacks are scoped only to the object they are deﬁned on, and are not inherited by any\\nchildren of the object.\\nDANGER\\nConstructor callbacks are scoped only to the object they are deﬁned on. They are not inherited by children of the object.\\nIf you\\'re creating a custom chain or runnable, you need to remember to propagate request time callbacks to any child objects.\\nASYNC IN PYTHON<=3.10\\nAny RunnableLambda, a RunnableGenerator, or Tool that invokes other runnables and is running async in python<=3.10, will\\nhave to propagate callbacks to child objects manually. This is because LangChain cannot automatically propagate callbacks\\nto child objects in this case.\\nThis is a common reason why you may fail to see events being emitted from custom runnables or tools.\\nFor speciﬁcs on how to use callbacks, see the relevant how-to guides here.\\nTechniques\\nStreaming\\nIndividual LLM calls often run for much longer than traditional resource requests. This compounds when you build more complex\\nchains or agents that require multiple reasoning steps.\\nFortunately, LLMs generate output iteratively, which means it\\'s possible to show sensible intermediate results before the ﬁnal\\nresponse is ready. Consuming output as soon as it becomes available has therefore become a vital part of the UX around building\\napps with LLMs to help alleviate latency issues, and LangChain aims to have ﬁrst-class support for streaming.\\nBelow, we\\'ll discuss some concepts and considerations around streaming in LangChain.\\n.stream() and .astream()\\nMost modules in LangChain include the .stream() method (and the equivalent .astream() method for async environments) as\\nan ergonomic streaming interface. .stream() returns an iterator, which you can consume with a simple for loop. Here\\'s an\\nexample with a chat model:\\nAPI Reference:ChatAnthropic\\nFor models (or other components) that don\\'t support streaming natively, this iterator would just yield a single chunk, but you could\\nstill use the same general pattern when calling them. Using .stream() will also automatically call the model in streaming mode\\nwithout the need to provide additional conﬁg.\\nThe type of each outputted chunk depends on the type of component - for example, chat models yield AIMessageChunks. Because\\nthis method is part of LangChain Expression Language, you can handle formatting differences from different outputs using an\\noutput parser to transform each yielded chunk.\\nYou can check out this guide for more detail on how to use .stream().\\n.astream_events()\\nWhile the .stream() method is intuitive, it can only return the ﬁnal generated value of your chain. This is ﬁne for single LLM calls,\\nbut as you build more complex chains of several LLM calls together, you may want to use the intermediate values of the chain\\nalongside the ﬁnal output - for example, returning sources alongside the ﬁnal generation when building a chat over documents\\napp.\\nThere are ways to do this using callbacks, or by constructing your chain in such a way that it passes intermediate values to the\\nend with something like chained .assign() calls, but LangChain also includes an .astream_events() method that combines the\\nﬂexibility of callbacks with the ergonomics of .stream(). When called, it returns an iterator which yields various types of events\\nthat you can ﬁlter and process according to the needs of your project.\\nHere\\'s one small example that prints just events containing streamed chat model output:\\nAPI Reference:StrOutputParser | ChatPromptTemplate | ChatAnthropic\\nYou can roughly think of it as an iterator over callback events (though the format differs) - and you can use it on almost all\\nLangChain components!\\nSee this guide for more detailed information on how to use .astream_events(), including a table listing available events.\\nCallbacks\\nThe lowest level way to stream outputs from LLMs in LangChain is via the callbacks system. You can pass a callback handler that\\nhandles the on_llm_new_token event into LangChain components. When that component is invoked, any LLM or chat model\\ncontained in the component calls the callback with the generated token. Within the callback, you could pipe the tokens into some\\nother destination, e.g. a HTTP response. You can also handle the on_llm_end event to perform any necessary cleanup.\\nYou can see this how-to section for more speciﬁcs on using callbacks.\\nCallbacks were the ﬁrst technique for streaming introduced in LangChain. While powerful and generalizable, they can be\\nunwieldy for developers. For example:\\nYou need to explicitly initialize and manage some aggregator or other stream to collect results.\\nThe execution order isn\\'t explicitly guaranteed, and you could theoretically have a callback run after the .invoke() method\\nﬁnishes.\\nProviders would often make you pass an additional parameter to stream outputs instead of returning them all at once.\\nYou would often ignore the result of the actual model call in favor of callback results.\\nTokens\\nThe unit that most model providers use to measure input and output is via a unit called a token. Tokens are the basic units that\\nlanguage models read and generate when processing or producing text. The exact deﬁnition of a token can vary depending on the\\nspeciﬁc way the model was trained - for instance, in English, a token could be a single word like \"apple\", or a part of a word like\\n\"app\".\\nWhen you send a model a prompt, the words and characters in the prompt are encoded into tokens using a tokenizer. The model\\nthen streams back generated output tokens, which the tokenizer decodes into human-readable text. The below example shows\\nhow OpenAI models tokenize LangChain is cool!:\\nYou can see that it gets split into 5 different tokens, and that the boundaries between tokens are not exactly the same as word\\nboundaries.\\nThe reason language models use tokens rather than something more immediately intuitive like \"characters\" has to do with how\\nthey process and understand text. At a high-level, language models iteratively predict their next generated output based on the\\ninitial input and their previous generations. Training the model using tokens language models to handle linguistic units (like words\\nor subwords) that carry meaning, rather than individual characters, which makes it easier for the model to learn and understand\\nthe structure of the language, including grammar and context. Furthermore, using tokens can also improve efﬁciency, since the\\nmodel processes fewer units of text compared to character-level processing.\\nStructured output\\nLLMs are capable of generating arbitrary text. This enables the model to respond appropriately to a wide range of inputs, but for\\nsome use-cases, it can be useful to constrain the LLM\\'s output to a speciﬁc format or structure. This is referred to as structured\\noutput.\\nFor example, if the output is to be stored in a relational database, it is much easier if the model generates output that adheres to a\\ndeﬁned schema or format. Extracting speciﬁc information from unstructured text is another case where this is particularly useful.\\nMost commonly, the output format will be JSON, though other formats such as YAML can be useful too. Below, we\\'ll discuss a few\\nways to get structured output from models in LangChain.\\n.with_structured_output()\\nFor convenience, some LangChain chat models support a .with_structured_output() method. This method only requires a\\nschema as input, and returns a dict or Pydantic object. Generally, this method is only present on models that support one of the\\nmore advanced methods described below, and will use one of them under the hood. It takes care of importing a suitable output\\nparser and formatting the schema in the right format for the model.\\nFor more information, check out this how-to guide.\\nRaw prompting\\nThe most intuitive way to get a model to structure output is to ask nicely. In addition to your query, you can give instructions\\ndescribing what kind of output you\\'d like, then parse the output using an output parser to convert the raw model message or\\nstring output into something more easily manipulated.\\nThe biggest beneﬁt to raw prompting is its ﬂexibility:\\nRaw prompting does not require any special model features, only sufﬁcient reasoning capability to understand the passed\\nschema.\\nYou can prompt for any format you\\'d like, not just JSON. This can be useful if the model you are using is more heavily trained\\non a certain type of data, such as XML or YAML.\\nHowever, there are some drawbacks too:\\nLLMs are non-deterministic, and prompting a LLM to consistently output data in the exactly correct format for smooth\\nparsing can be surprisingly difﬁcult and model-speciﬁc.\\nIndividual models have quirks depending on the data they were trained on, and optimizing prompts can be quite difﬁcult.\\nSome may be better at interpreting JSON schema, others may be best with TypeScript deﬁnitions, and still others may prefer\\nXML.\\nWhile we\\'ll next go over some ways that you can take advantage of features offered by model providers to increase reliability,\\nprompting techniques remain important for tuning your results no matter what method you choose.\\nJSON mode\\nSome models, such as Mistral, OpenAI, Together AI and Ollama, support a feature called JSON mode, usually enabled via conﬁg.\\nWhen enabled, JSON mode will constrain the model\\'s output to always be some sort of valid JSON. Often they require some\\ncustom prompting, but it\\'s usually much less burdensome and along the lines of, \"you must always return JSON\", and the\\noutput is easier to parse.\\nIt\\'s also generally simpler and more commonly available than tool calling.\\nHere\\'s an example:\\nAPI Reference:ChatPromptTemplate | ChatOpenAI | SimpleJsonOutputParser\\nFor a full list of model providers that support JSON mode, see this table.\\nFunction/tool calling\\nINFO\\nWe use the term tool calling interchangeably with function calling. Although function calling is sometimes meant to refer to\\ninvocations of a single function, we treat all models as though they can return multiple tool or function calls in each message\\nTool calling allows a model to respond to a given prompt by generating output that matches a user-deﬁned schema. While the\\nname implies that the model is performing some action, this is actually not the case! The model is coming up with the arguments\\nto a tool, and actually running the tool (or not) is up to the user - for example, if you want to extract output matching some schema\\nfrom unstructured text, you could give the model an \"extraction\" tool that takes parameters matching the desired schema, then\\ntreat the generated output as your ﬁnal result.\\nFor models that support it, tool calling can be very convenient. It removes the guesswork around how best to prompt schemas in\\nfavor of a built-in model feature. It can also more naturally support agentic ﬂows, since you can just pass multiple tool schemas\\ninstead of ﬁddling with enums or unions.\\nMany LLM providers, including Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Mistral, OpenAI, and others, support variants of a tool calling feature.\\nThese features typically allow requests to the LLM to include available tools and their schemas, and for responses to include calls\\nto these tools. For instance, given a search engine tool, an LLM might handle a query by ﬁrst issuing a call to the search engine.\\nThe system calling the LLM can receive the tool call, execute it, and return the output to the LLM to inform its response.\\nLangChain includes a suite of built-in tools and supports several methods for deﬁning your own custom tools.\\nLangChain provides a standardized interface for tool calling that is consistent across different models.\\nThe standard interface consists of:\\nChatModel.bind_tools(): a method for specifying which tools are available for a model to call. This method accepts\\nLangChain tools here.\\nAIMessage.tool_calls: an attribute on the AIMessage returned from the model for accessing the tool calls requested by the\\nmodel.\\nThe following how-to guides are good practical resources for using function/tool calling:\\nHow to return structured data from an LLM\\nHow to use a model to call tools\\nFor a full list of model providers that support tool calling, see this table.\\nRetrieval\\nLLMs are trained on a large but ﬁxed dataset, limiting their ability to reason over private or recent information. Fine-tuning an\\nLLM with speciﬁc facts is one way to mitigate this, but is often poorly suited for factual recall and can be costly. Retrieval is the\\nprocess of providing relevant information to an LLM to improve its response for a given input. Retrieval augmented generation\\n(RAG) is the process of grounding the LLM generation (output) using the retrieved information.\\nTIP\\nSee our RAG from Scratch code and video series.\\nFor a high-level guide on retrieval, see this tutorial on RAG.\\nRAG is only as good as the retrieved documents’ relevance and quality. Fortunately, an emerging set of techniques can be\\nemployed to design and improve RAG systems. We\\'ve focused on taxonomizing and summarizing many of these techniques (see\\nbelow ﬁgure) and will share some high-level strategic guidance in the following sections. You can and should experiment with\\nusing different pieces together. You might also ﬁnd this LangSmith guide useful for showing how to evaluate different iterations\\nof your app.\\nQuery Translation\\nFirst, consider the user input(s) to your RAG system. Ideally, a RAG system can handle a wide range of inputs, from poorly worded\\nquestions to complex multi-part queries. Using an LLM to review and optionally modify the input is the central idea behind query\\ntranslation. This serves as a general buffer, optimizing raw user inputs for your retrieval system. For example, this can be as\\nsimple as extracting keywords or as complex as generating multiple sub-questions for a complex query.\\nName When to use Description\\nMulti-queryWhen you need to cover\\nmultiple perspectives of a\\nquestion.Rewrite the user question from multiple perspectives, retrieve\\ndocuments for each rewritten question, return the unique documents for\\nall queries.\\nDecompositionWhen a question can be broken\\ndown into smaller\\nsubproblems.Decompose a question into a set of subproblems / questions, which can\\neither be solved sequentially (use the answer from ﬁrst + retrieval to\\nanswer the second) or in parallel (consolidate each answer into ﬁnal\\nanswer).\\nStep-backWhen a higher-level\\nconceptual understanding is\\nrequired.First prompt the LLM to ask a generic step-back question about higher-\\nlevel concepts or principles, and retrieve relevant facts about them. Use\\nthis grounding to help answer the user question.\\nHyDEIf you have challenges\\nretrieving relevant documents\\nusing the raw user inputs.Use an LLM to convert questions into hypothetical documents that\\nanswer the question. Use the embedded hypothetical documents to\\nretrieve real documents with the premise that doc-doc similarity search\\ncan produce more relevant matches.\\nTIP\\nSee our RAG from Scratch videos for a few different speciﬁc approaches:\\nMulti-query\\nDecomposition\\nStep-back\\nHyDE\\nRouting\\nSecond, consider the data sources available to your RAG system. You want to query across more than one database or across\\nstructured and unstructured data sources. Using an LLM to review the input and route it to the appropriate data source is a\\nsimple and effective approach for querying across sources.\\nName When to use Description\\nLogical\\nroutingWhen you can prompt an LLM with rules\\nto decide where to route the input.Logical routing can use an LLM to reason about the query and\\nchoose which datastore is most appropriate.\\nSemantic\\nroutingWhen semantic similarity is an effective\\nway to determine where to route the\\ninput.Semantic routing embeds both query and, typically a set of\\nprompts. It then chooses the appropriate prompt based upon\\nsimilarity.\\nTIP\\nSee our RAG from Scratch video on routing.\\nQuery Construction\\nThird, consider whether any of your data sources require speciﬁc query formats. Many structured databases use SQL. Vector\\nstores often have speciﬁc syntax for applying keyword ﬁlters to document metadata. Using an LLM to convert a natural language\\nquery into a query syntax is a popular and powerful approach. In particular, text-to-SQL, text-to-Cypher, and query analysis for\\nmetadata ﬁlters are useful ways to interact with structured, graph, and vector databases respectively.\\nName When to Use Description\\nText to\\nSQLIf users are asking questions that require\\ninformation housed in a relational\\ndatabase, accessible via SQL.This uses an LLM to transform user input into a SQL query.\\nText-to-\\nCypherIf users are asking questions that require\\ninformation housed in a graph database,\\naccessible via Cypher.This uses an LLM to transform user input into a Cypher query.\\nSelf\\nQueryIf users are asking questions that are\\nbetter answered by fetching documents\\nbased on metadata rather than similarity\\nwith the text.This uses an LLM to transform user input into two things: (1) a string\\nto look up semantically, (2) a metadata ﬁlter to go along with it. This\\nis useful because oftentimes questions are about the METADATA of\\ndocuments (not the content itself).\\nTIP\\nSee our blog post overview and RAG from Scratch video on query construction, the process of text-to-DSL where DSL is a\\ndomain speciﬁc language required to interact with a given database. This converts user questions into structured queries.\\nIndexing\\nFouth, consider the design of your document index. A simple and powerful idea is to decouple the documents that you index for\\nretrieval from the documents that you pass to the LLM for generation. Indexing frequently uses embedding models with vector\\nstores, which compress the semantic information in documents to ﬁxed-size vectors.\\nMany RAG approaches focus on splitting documents into chunks and retrieving some number based on similarity to an input\\nquestion for the LLM. But chunk size and chunk number can be difﬁcult to set and affect results if they do not provide full context\\nfor the LLM to answer a question. Furthermore, LLMs are increasingly capable of processing millions of tokens.\\nTwo approaches can address this tension: (1) Multi Vector retriever using an LLM to translate documents into any form (e.g., often\\ninto a summary) that is well-suited for indexing, but returns full documents to the LLM for generation. (2) ParentDocument\\nretriever embeds document chunks, but also returns full documents. The idea is to get the best of both worlds: use concise\\nrepresentations (summaries or chunks) for retrieval, but use the full documents for answer generation.\\nName Index TypeUses an LLM When to Use Description\\nVector store Vector storeNoIf you are just getting\\nstarted and looking for\\nsomething quick and easy.This is the simplest method and the one\\nthat is easiest to get started with. It\\ninvolves creating embeddings for each\\npiece of text.\\nParentDocumentVector store\\n+ Document\\nStoreNoIf your pages have lots of\\nsmaller pieces of distinct\\ninformation that are best\\nindexed by themselves, but\\nbest retrieved all together.This involves indexing multiple chunks\\nfor each document. Then you ﬁnd the\\nchunks that are most similar in\\nembedding space, but you retrieve the\\nwhole parent document and return that\\n(rather than individual chunks).\\nMulti VectorVector store\\n+ Document\\nStoreSometimes\\nduring\\nindexingIf you are able to extract\\ninformation from\\ndocuments that you think is\\nmore relevant to index than\\nthe text itself.This involves creating multiple vectors\\nfor each document. Each vector could\\nbe created in a myriad of ways -\\nexamples include summaries of the\\ntext and hypothetical questions.\\nTime-Weighted\\nVector storeVector storeNoIf you have timestamps\\nassociated with your\\ndocuments, and you want\\nto retrieve the most recent\\nonesThis fetches documents based on a\\ncombination of semantic similarity (as\\nin normal vector retrieval) and recency\\n(looking at timestamps of indexed\\ndocuments)\\nTIP\\nSee our RAG from Scratch video on indexing fundamentals\\nSee our RAG from Scratch video on multi vector retriever\\nFifth, consider ways to improve the quality of your similarity search itself. Embedding models compress text into ﬁxed-length\\n(vector) representations that capture the semantic content of the document. This compression is useful for search / retrieval, but\\nputs a heavy burden on that single vector representation to capture the semantic nuance / detail of the document. In some cases,\\nirrelevant or redundant content can dilute the semantic usefulness of the embedding.\\nColBERT is an interesting approach to address this with a higher granularity embeddings: (1) produce a contextually inﬂuenced\\nembedding for each token in the document and query, (2) score similarity between each query token and all document tokens, (3)\\ntake the max, (4) do this for all query tokens, and (5) take the sum of the max scores (in step 3) for all query tokens to get a query-\\ndocument similarity score; this token-wise scoring can yield strong results.\\nThere are some additional tricks to improve the quality of your retrieval. Embeddings excel at capturing semantic information, but\\nmay struggle with keyword-based queries. Many vector stores offer built-in hybrid-search to combine keyword and semantic\\nsimilarity, which marries the beneﬁts of both approaches. Furthermore, many vector stores have maximal marginal relevance,\\nwhich attempts to diversify the results of a search to avoid returning similar and redundant documents.\\nName When to use Description\\nColBERTWhen higher granularity\\nembeddings are needed.ColBERT uses contextually inﬂuenced embeddings for each token\\nin the document and query to get a granular query-document\\nsimilarity score.\\nHybrid searchWhen combining keyword-\\nbased and semantic similarity.Hybrid search combines keyword and semantic similarity, marrying\\nthe beneﬁts of both approaches.\\nMaximal Marginal\\nRelevance (MMR)When needing to diversify\\nsearch results.MMR attempts to diversify the results of a search to avoid\\nreturning similar and redundant documents.\\nTIP\\nSee our RAG from Scratch video on ColBERT.\\nPost-processing\\nSixth, consider ways to ﬁlter or rank retrieved documents. This is very useful if you are combining documents returned from\\nmultiple sources, since it can can down-rank less relevant documents and / or compress similar documents.\\nNameIndex\\nTypeUses an\\nLLMWhen to Use Description\\nContextual\\nCompressionAnySometimesIf you are ﬁnding that your\\nretrieved documents contain too\\nmuch irrelevant information and\\nare distracting the LLM.This puts a post-processing step on top of\\nanother retriever and extracts only the most\\nrelevant information from retrieved\\ndocuments. This can be done with\\nembeddings or an LLM.\\nEnsembleAnyNoIf you have multiple retrieval\\nmethods and want to try\\ncombining them.This fetches documents from multiple\\nretrievers and then combines them.\\nRe-rankingAnyYesIf you want to rank retrieved\\ndocuments based upon relevance,\\nespecially if you want to combine\\nresults from multiple retrieval\\nmethods .Given a query and a list of documents,\\nRerank indexes the documents from most\\nto least semantically relevant to the query.\\nTIP\\nSee our RAG from Scratch video on RAG-Fusion, on approach for post-processing across multiple queries: Rewrite the user\\nquestion from multiple perspectives, retrieve documents for each rewritten question, and combine the ranks of multiple\\nsearch result lists to produce a single, uniﬁed ranking with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).\\nGeneration\\nFinally, consider ways to build self-correction into your RAG system. RAG systems can suffer from low quality retrieval (e.g., if a\\nuser question is out of the domain for the index) and / or hallucinations in generation. A naive retrieve-generate pipeline has no\\nability to detect or self-correct from these kinds of errors. The concept of \"ﬂow engineering\" has been introduced in the context\\nof code generation: iteratively build an answer to a code question with unit tests to check and self-correct errors. Several works\\nhave applied this RAG, such as Self-RAG and Corrective-RAG. In both cases, checks for document relevance, hallucinations, and /\\nor answer quality are performed in the RAG answer generation ﬂow.\\nWe\\'ve found that graphs are a great way to reliably express logical ﬂows and have implemented ideas from several of these\\npapers using LangGraph, as shown in the ﬁgure below (red - routing, blue - fallback, green - self-correction):\\nRouting: Adaptive RAG (paper). Route questions to different retrieval approaches, as discussed above\\nFallback: Corrective RAG (paper). Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query\\nSelf-correction: Self-RAG (paper). Fix answers w/ hallucinations or don’t address question\\nName When to use Description\\nSelf-RAGWhen needing to ﬁx answers\\nwith hallucinations or irrelevant\\ncontent.Self-RAG performs checks for document relevance, hallucinations, and\\nanswer quality during the RAG answer generation ﬂow, iteratively\\nbuilding an answer and self-correcting errors.\\nCorrective-\\nRAGWhen needing a fallback\\nmechanism for low relevance\\ndocs.Corrective-RAG includes a fallback (e.g., to web search) if the retrieved\\ndocuments are not relevant to the query, ensuring higher quality and\\nmore relevant retrieval.\\nTIP\\nSee several videos and cookbooks showcasing RAG with LangGraph:\\nLangGraph Corrective RAG\\nLangGraph combining Adaptive, Self-RAG, and Corrective RAG\\nCookbooks for RAG using LangGraph\\nSee our LangGraph RAG recipes with partners:\\nMeta\\nMistral\\nText spli\\ue009ing\\nLangChain offers many different types of text splitters.

LCEL was designed from day 1 to\\nsupport putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest “prompt + LLM” chain to the most complex\\nchains (we’ve seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you\\nmight want to use LCEL:\\nFirst-class streaming support When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-ﬁrst-token (time elapsed\\nuntil the ﬁrst chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming\\noutput parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw\\ntokens.', 'document_title': 'langchain_guide.pdf'}, {'page_content': 'tokens.\\nAsync support Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while\\nprototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a LangServe server). This enables using the same code for prototypes\\nand in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server.\\nOptimized parallel execution Whenever your LCEL chains have steps that can be executed in parallel (eg if you fetch documents\\nfrom multiple retrievers) we automatically do it, both in the sync and the async interfaces, for the smallest possible latency.\\nRetries and fallbacks Conﬁgure retries and fallbacks for any part of your LCEL chain. This is a great way to make your chains\\nmore reliable at scale. We’re currently working on adding streaming support for retries/fallbacks, so you can get the added\\nreliability without any latency cost.', 'document_title': 'langchain_guide.pdf'}, {'page_content': 'reliability without any latency cost.\\nAccess intermediate results For more complex chains it’s often very useful to access the results of intermediate steps even\\nbefore the ﬁnal output is produced. This can be used to let end-users know something is happening, or even just to debug your\\nchain. You can stream intermediate results, and it’s available on every LangServe server.\\nInput and output schemas Input and output schemas give every LCEL chain Pydantic and JSONSchema schemas inferred from\\nthe structure of your chain. This can be used for validation of inputs and outputs, and is an integral part of LangServe.\\nSeamless LangSmith tracing As your chains get more and more complex, it becomes increasingly important to understand what\\nexactly is happening at every step.

Tokens are the basic units that\\nlanguage models read and generate when processing or producing text. The exact deﬁnition of a token can vary depending on the\\nspeciﬁc way the model was trained - for instance, in English, a token could be a single word like \"apple\", or a part of a word like\\n\"app\".\\nWhen you send a model a prompt, the words and characters in the prompt are encoded into tokens using a tokenizer. The model\\nthen streams back generated output tokens, which the tokenizer decodes into human-readable text.

Training the model using tokens language models to handle linguistic units (like words\\nor subwords) that carry meaning, rather than individual characters, which makes it easier for the model to learn and understand\\nthe structure of the language, including grammar and context.
